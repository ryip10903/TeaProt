### urPTMdb
urPTMdb is a database of gene-sets covering currently underrepresented post-translational moditications (PTMs). Previously published studies and datasets (PRIDE / MASSIVE) are analyzed to identify substrates or interactions relating to PTMs. We have analyzed the results of 29 studies, generating 63 gene-sets covering 10 underrepresented PTMs. Additionally, we generated pathway gene-sets of the primary enzymes involved in the PTMs, as well as consensus gene-sets where replicate studies were available.
