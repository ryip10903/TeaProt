### __urPTMdb__
<p>urPTMdb is a database of gene-sets covering currently underrepresented post-translational moditications (PTMs). Previously published studies and datasets (PRIDE / MASSIVE) are analyzed to identify substrates or interactions relating to PTMs. We have analyzed the results of 58 studies, generating 141 gene-sets covering 18 underrepresented PTMs. Additionally, we generated pathway gene-sets of the primary enzymes involved in the PTMs, as well as consensus gene-sets where replicate studies were available.</p>
